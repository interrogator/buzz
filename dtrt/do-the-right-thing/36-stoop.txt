What do you know 'bout me? Y'all can't even pee straight. What do you know? Until you have stood in the doorway and heard the hunger of your five children, unable to do a damn thing about it, you don't know shit. You don't know my pain, you don't know me. Don't call me a bum, don't call me a drunk, you don't know me, and it's disrespectful. I know your parents raised you better. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="36" stage_direction="true" speaker="DA MAYOR" line="334">
