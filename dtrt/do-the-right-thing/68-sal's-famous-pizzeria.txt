No, you're tripping. Don't come in Sal's. Alright, read my lips. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="68" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="557">
What are you so worked up about? <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="68" stage_direction="true" speaker="JADE" line="558">
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="68" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="559">

You are too crude. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="68" stage_direction="true" speaker="JADE" line="566">
I might be, but you're not welcome here. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="68" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="567">

Pretty soon I'll be making a move. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="68" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="573">
I truly hope so. I'm tired of supporting a grown man. <metadata time="DUSK" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="68" stage_direction="true" speaker="JADE" line="574">
