Customers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy. Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of BUGGIN' OUT, a b-boy. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true">
You paying now or on layaway? <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="SAL" line="106">

Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="109">

Two dollars! Forget it! <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="111">
Buggin' Out slams his money down on the counter, takes his slice and sits down. All around Buggin' Out, peering down from the WALL OF FAME, are signed, framed, eight by ten glossies of famous Italian Americans. WE SEE Joe DiMaggio, Rocky Marciano, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Liza Minnelli, Governor Mario Cuomo, Al Pacino and, of course, how can we forget Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa: THE ITALIAN STALLION, also RAMBO. He looks at the pictures hovering above him. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true">

Ask Sal. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="115">
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here? <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="116">
You want brothers up on the Wall of Fame, you open up your own business, then you can do what you wanna do. My pizzeria, Italian Americans up on the wall. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="SAL" line="117">
Take it easy, Pop. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="VITO" line="118">
Don't start on me today. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="SAL" line="119">
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="BUGGIN' OUT" line="120">

Sal comes from behind the counter with his Louisville Slugger Mickey Mantle model baseball bat. Vito is by his side, but Mookie intercepts them, and takes Buggin' Out outside. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true">
Don't come back, either. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="19" stage_direction="true" speaker="SAL" line="124">
