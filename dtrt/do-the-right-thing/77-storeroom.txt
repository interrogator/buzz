Vito, I want you to listen to me. I'm your brother. I may smack you around once in awhile, boss you around, but I'm still your brother. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true" speaker="PINO" line="660">

Good. I want you to listen. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true" speaker="PINO" line="664">
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true" speaker="VITO" line="665">
Good. Vito, you trust that Mook too much. So does Pop. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true" speaker="PINO" line="666">

Mookie is not to be trusted. No Moulan Yan can be trusted. The first time you turn your back, Mookie is not to be trusted. No Moulan Yan can be trusted.

So what do you want me to do? <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true" speaker="VITO" line="675">
Be on guard. Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true" speaker="PINO" line="676">
I like Mookie a lot. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true" speaker="VITO" line="677">

THE BLOCK. WE'VE SEEN it at daytime, but now WE SEE it at night. Even though the white-hot sun is gone, nonetheless the heat is still stifling. And in a peculiar, funny sort of way, it's worse. You expect it to be hot during the light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well, not tonight, it's hot. All the residents of The Block: the Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc., all the people WE'VE SEEN throughout the day are now coping with the night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit. Everyone is outside, sitting on stoops, on cars and you know the kids are playing, running up and down the block. Now it's the hottest night of the year. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="STOREROOM" scene="77" stage_direction="true">
