Buggin' Out is walking down the block when CLIFTON, a yuppie, accidentally bumps into him, stepping on his new sneakers. He looks at his sneakers. There is a big black smudge on his new white unlaced Air Jordans. He runs down the block after Clifton. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET" scene="33" stage_direction="true">
