A group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone. They are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true">

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box. The sound gets louder as the box gets closer. The youths look down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them. He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop. This is RADIO RAHEEM. The size of his box is tremendous and one has to think, how does he carry something that big around with him? It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk shakes as the rap music blares out. The song we hear is the only one Radio Raheem plays. Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and turns down the volume. It's quiet again. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STOOP" scene="11" stage_direction="true">
