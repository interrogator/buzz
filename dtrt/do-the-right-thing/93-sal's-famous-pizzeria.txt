Some burnt photos on the floor. The Mickey Mantle bat burns. Radio Raheem's box has melted into a black mass of goo. As WE MOVE IN TIGHTER ON the melted box, we begin to hear the rap song that we've hear throughout. All other sound drops as the rap song gets louder and louder until it's deafening. Smiley sits up from where he hid during the burning and looting of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Smiley looks around and goes directly to the smoldering Wall of Fame. He stands there. Smiley pins one of his Malcolm X/Martin Luther King, Jr., cards to the Wall of Fame. We're on Smiley's face and a smile slowly travels across. It's the first time Smiley has smiled in years and nobody is there to see this event. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="INT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="93" stage_direction="true">
