Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall, a small group of men meet. They have no steady employment, nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift of gab. These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get philosophical. These men become the great thinkers of the world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the homeless, and AIDS. They're called the Corner Men: SWEET DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML. All three are sitting in folding chairs up against a wall in the shade. <metadata time="DAY" loc="EXT" setting="STREET CORNER" scene="18" stage_direction="true" speaker="stage_direction">
