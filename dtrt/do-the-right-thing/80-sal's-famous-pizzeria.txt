The tangled mass of choking, biting, kicking, screaming confusion flies through the door of Sal's out onto the sidewalk. The kid yells: <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">

He also looks up. The people on The Block run to Sal's Famous Pizzeria to see the STATIC. Radio Raheem, Buggin' Out, Sal, Vito, and Pino are still entangled, rolling around on the sidewalk, but now before an entertained crowd of onlookers: <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">
Break it up. This is crazy.. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true" speaker="DA MAYOR" line="723"> <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true" speaker="DA MAYOR" line="723">
The fight continues. Da Mayor is smart enough not to get in the middle of this war. We hear sirens, somebody has called The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running over some people. The cops get out with nightsticks and guns drawn. WE RECOGNIZE two of the faces, Officers Long and Ponte. Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are gonna go for. You know the deal! Buggin' Out is pulled off first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man. It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a beet from being choked. Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other cops put a choke hold on Radio Raheem to restrain him. Radio Raheem is still struggling, then he just stops, his body goes limp and he falls to the sidewalk like a fifty- pound bag of Idaho potatoes. Officers Long and Ponte kick him. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">

Radio Raheem just lies there like a bump on a log. The crowd stares at Radio Raheem's still body. He's unconscious or dead. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">

The officers all look at each other. They know, they know exactly what they've done. The infamous Michael Stewart choke hold. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">

The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him into the back seat. Buggin' Out is pushed into another car. The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have left the crowd. It's at this point the crowd becomes an angry mob. The mob looks at... Sal still on the sidewalk, being helped to his feet by Vito and Pino, who are in bad shape themselves. The mood/tone of the mob is getting ugly. Once again they have seen one of their own killed before their eyes at the hands of the cops. We hear the murmurs of the folks go through the crowd. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">

The cops, in their haste to get Radio Raheem out of there, have left an angry mob of Black folks with a defenseless Sal, Vito, and Pino. The mob looks at them. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">

Mookie looks at the crowd and notices he's on the wrong side. He leaves Sal and his two sons. Da Mayor walks in front of the crowd. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" camera_angle="HIGH ANGLE" stage_direction="true">

Mookie picks up a garbage can and dumps it out into the street. He walks through the crowd, up to Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino. He screams. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">

Mookie hurls the garbage can through the plate glass window of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. That's it. All hell breaks loose. The dam has been unplugged, broke. The rage of a people has been unleashed, a fury. A lone garbage can thrown through the air has released a tidal wave of frustration. Da Mayor pushes Sal, Vito, and Pino out of the way as the mob storms into Sal's Famous Pizzeria. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="80" stage_direction="true">
