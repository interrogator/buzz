Mookie is hiking up a flight of stairs. He puts the pizza box down and takes a breather. Sweat drips off his face. He bends down to pick up the pizza box and tackles the last few flights. Mookie pushes the buzzer. A young Puerto Rican woman opens the door. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true">
I hope it's not cold. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true" speaker="NILDA" line="143">
Mookie hands her the pizza. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true">
No, it's not cold. Twelve dollars for the pie. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="144">
Nilda hands him a handful of singles. Mookie looks at the crumpled mess. Nilda attempts to close the door, but Mookie's foot says, "Hell no." <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true">
Hold it. Let me count this first. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="145">

Look, lady. I carried your pizza up five flights of stairs and shit. The cheese didn't slide over to one side like it sometimes does with delivery people who don't care. I do care. May I get paid? <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="150">
Nilda looks at him and sees right away he's not going anywhere. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true">
Wait here. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true" speaker="NILDA" line="151">
I'll wait. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true" speaker="MOOKIE" line="152">
Nilda goes into the apartment and we hear her talking in Spanish to a male. Mookie bends down to tie his sneakers. Nilda reappears and holds out a lonely lone dollar for him. Mookie has her hold it out for awhile, then he takes it. <metadata time="DAY" loc="INT" setting="TENEMENT BUILDING" scene="23" stage_direction="true">
