The mob doesn't listen, they will not be moved. The mob will not be moved until they see Sal's Famous Pizzeria burn to the ground. The firemen douse the pizzeria, trying desperately to stop the fire from spreading into the adjoining buildings. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="89" stage_direction="true">

The hoses are turned on the mob. WE SEE Mookie, Mother Sister, Sweet Dick Willie, ML, Coconut Sid, Jade, Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella, etc., go down before the powerful blast of the firehouse. Now we've come full circle. We're back to Montgomery or Birmingham, Alabama. The only thing missing is Sheriff Bull Connor and the German shepherds. It would take force to move them and that's exactly what the mob got. People are trying to hold on to each other, cars, railings, anything to keep from being swept away. <metadata time="NIGHT" loc="EXT" setting="SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA" scene="89" stage_direction="true">
